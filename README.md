# Masters Degree Project
By Michael Godden, BSc (Hons).
## About
This is a masters degree project that investigates timestamping as a glitch avoidance mechanism in a distributed reactive web application. BaconJs is used as the functional reactive programming (FRP) library, lodash is used for mundane functional programming tasks.

## Equipment
* Linux - this code was written on a linux mint vm. It should work in any Linux or Mac environment.
* Bower
* GulpJs - user node to install gulp-cli
* GruntJs - use node to install grunt-cli
* Heroku - was used as a test server.
* MongoDb - needs to be install for logging.
* NodeJs - version 6.9.1 or higher
* Yeoman - the Es6-Express generator was used to scaffold the application. Unfortunately it uses Jade as the template engine; I replaced Jade with Handlebars.

## Usage
:~> npm install<br />
:~> gulp<br />
Navigate browser to http://localhost:5000
